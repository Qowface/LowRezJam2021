64x64 resolution puzzle game created in MonoGame for [LOWREZJAM 2021](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2021), which ran from August 1st to August 14th, 2021.

You are presented with a board of tiles, with values 0 through 3. All tiles start out flipped face down, and on each turn, you flip over a tile. If a 0 is flipped over, the game is lost. If all of the 2 and 3 tiles are flipped over, the game is won. Each row and column on the board is labeled with the total value of the tiles in that row/column, as well as a count of how many 0's are in that row/column.

Game mechanics are based on the Voltorb Flip minigame from Pokemon HG/SS.

Didn't have a chance to add everything I wanted to, but submitted what I had time to complete over on [itch.io](https://qowface.itch.io/zeroflip64). :)
